Birthday paradox:

In a room of just 23 people there’s a 50-50 chance of two people having the same birthday. In a room of 75 there’s a 99.9% chance of two people matching.

2 people having different bday - > 364/365
23 people -> 253 different pairs.
Chance of 253 people having different bday -> (364/365) ^ 253 = 0.4995
1 - 0.4995 = 0.5005 => 2 people having same bday.
